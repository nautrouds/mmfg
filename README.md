# MMFG

MMFG is a high-performance Inter-Process Communication (IPC) framework designed for sub-microsecond latency and extremely high concurrency requirements. It combines zero-copy data transfer mechanisms using `memfd_create` and `mmap`, and utilizes Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) and `eventfd` for efficient signal delivery.

MMFG is primarily used to achieve **zero-copy chained processing** among multiple independent processes (Nodes). Through a "handoff" mechanism, data ownership can be transferred between nodes without any memory copying or reallocation, making it ideal for building high-performance data processing pipelines.

## Key Features

- **Zero-Copy Chained Processing**: The core advantage of MMFG. Data ownership can be transferred directly between nodes (`Next("NodeB")`) without releasing or reallocating memory, ensuring a completely zero-copy process.
- **Hub-and-Node Architecture**: A central Hub manages resources and coordinates multiple passive Nodes to perform tasks.
- **Low-Latency Signal Delivery**:
  - **Hub -> Node**: Each node has a dedicated `eventfd` for precise and low-latency waking, avoiding the "thundering herd" problem.
  - **Node -> Hub**: Uses a shared `eventfd` combined with a high-performance MPSC (Multi-Producer, Single-Consumer) ring buffer located in shared memory.
- **Dynamic Resource Management**:
  - **Chunks & Blocks**: Memory is managed in 4MB Chunks, further subdivided into 4KB Blocks.
  - **Auto-Scaling**: Supports dynamic expansion of Stripes to meet data growth demands.
- **Cross-Language Support**: Implementation provided for both Go and Rust.
- **Lock-Free Design**: Synchronization achieved through status bits and CAS (Compare-And-Swap) operations.

## Chained Processing (Handoff) Protocol

To maintain sub-microsecond latency in complex workflows, MMFG implements an atomic handoff protocol:

1. **Lazy Binding**: Connections start as local resources of the Hub. A global `SlotID` is only assigned upon the first data transfer to a Node.
2. **State Synchronization**: The Hub ensures the previous owner has completed its task (status is Done) before migrating access rights.
3. **Synchronous Handoff**: The `Next(nodeName)` method transfers ownership and **blocks** until the target node has finished processing, after which control (and updated metadata) is handed back to the Hub.
4. **Pipeline Efficiency**: Data flows from Node A to Node B to Node C, remaining in shared memory throughout the process with absolutely no copying.

## System Architecture

### Hub (Resource Manager)
The central controller of the system.
- Manages the Node connection pool.
- Allocates and manages the shared memory bus.
- Coordinates task dispatching and resource lifecycles.

### Node (Passive Responder)
Endpoints responsible for processing tasks assigned by the Hub.
- Listens for Hub connections via UDS.
- Directly operates on shared memory blocks.
- Reports task completion to the Hub via a shared response queue.

### Bus and Memory Layout
- **Chunk**: A 4MB memory unit created via `memfd_create`.
- **Block**: The smallest logical unit for resource allocation, sized at 4KB.
- **Stripe**: A sequence of Blocks. The first Block is the **Header Block**, storing metadata such as data length and the Block sequence.

## Usage Example (Go)

### Hub Side (Chained Processing)

```go
// 1. Initialize Hub
h, err := hub.NewHub()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// 2. Request a local connection (e.g., initial capacity of 2 Blocks)
// SlotID is not consumed at this stage, until the first call to Next()
conn, err := h.Request(ctx, 2, false)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer conn.Close()

// 3. Hub writes initial data locally
conn.Write([]byte("initial data"))

// 4. Transfer to Node_A and wait for it to finish processing
// This operation automatically binds the SlotID and notifies Node_A
if err := conn.Next("Node_A"); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// 5. Transfer to Node_B and wait for it to finish processing
// Data processed by Node_A is zero-copy visible to Node_B
if err := conn.Next("Node_B"); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// 6. Hub reads the final result
result := make([]byte, 1024)
n, _ := conn.Read(result)
fmt.Printf("Final result: %s\n", string(result[:n]))
```
